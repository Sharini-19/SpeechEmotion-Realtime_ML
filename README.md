Speech Emotion Recognition for Asperger Syndrome Children in real-time.


We are attempting to anticipate one of the six categories of emotions in our research (sad, neutral, happy, fear, angry, disgust). The projected emotions are then classified, and appropriate learning recommendations are provided. The children who are affected with Asperger syndrome will find difficulty in the general learning pattern and would need a special learning pattern for them to understand the basics. They have difficulty in exposing their feeling and emotions to others. This would help them to have a better understanding about their emotions and moods. In this their real time voice is acquired and then classified for the best fit emotion, then the suitable learning method is predicted for the resultant emotion.
